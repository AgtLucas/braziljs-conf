<p>Michal is an Open Web Alchemist from Warsaw, Poland, responsible for many ridiculous experiments like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/pl/demos/detail/css-nyan-cat">CSS Nyan Cat</a> or <a href="https://demoparty.mozillalabs.com/gallery/43/al-your-gradient-are-belong-to-us">All your gradient are belong to us</a>.
Michal officiates as an HTML5 GameDev trainer in W3C and ran technical workshops and tech-talks in many countries on different continents. He recently organized onGameStart, the first HTML5 games conference and wants to bring JavaScript to the last and forgotten continent - Antarctica, with <a href="http://twitter.com/antarcticjs">AntarcticJS</a>. He safely says that making web a better place is not just his job - it's his lifestyle. That's why he founds <a href="http://bly.sk">BLYSK</a>, soon-to-be-open-source first serious web animation tool</p>
